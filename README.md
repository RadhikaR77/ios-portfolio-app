# 📱 MyPortfolio – iOS Portfolio App

MyPortfolio is a SwiftUI-based iOS application created to showcase my iOS development skills through an interactive, real-world style application.

The app focuses on clean architecture, thoughtful user experience, and scalable design, using sample data for demonstration purposes.

---

## ✨ Overview

The app allows users to:
- Explore profile and portfolio-related content
- Provide structured feedback
- Review and sign a generated feedback document
- Experience intelligent, non-intrusive user interaction flows

> Note: All data shown in the app is sample data. Backend integration is intentionally left for future enhancement.
